\section{Motivation}
Automatic birdsong recognition is far from solved outside of controlled
environments or with heavy user input.
A system which can recognize species from birdsong from a wide variety of
species is an exciting application of signal processing, computer vision and
machine learning technologies.
Such software would be beneficial to the bird enthusiasts and environmental
health associations, and others.

\section{Goals}
The primary aim of this project is to research and develop potential methods
for automatic birdsong recognition, with little to no user interaction.
The system is to recognize up to 50 distinct bird species from field recordings
provided by arbitrary sources around the world.
The recordings should not have any form of rigorous quality control, aside from
the seletion of the least noisy recordings.

limit to songs only

\section{Approaches}
we can use this and that and dtw and image recognition though template matching
or deep learning etc statistical analysis of the audio data through spectral
analysis

\section{This Approach}
we use template matching
