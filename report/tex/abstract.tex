Automatic birdsong recognition is a sparsely studied subject.
This project takes an image recognition based machine learning approach 
to explore the viability of accurate automatic identification of a high number of
species present in actual field recordings around the world.
This task involves image processing and cross-correlation mechanisms to extract
characteristic song segments from spectrograms to help identify similarities 
between bird songs and classify species present in recordings using a random
forest classifer.
We conclude that an acceptable accuracy is achievable with the approached methods,
with possible limitations due to computational expenses.
