Automatic birdsong recognition is an interesting problem with many possible approaches.
In this project a machine learning approach is taken which explores the viability of high accuracy
bird species classification from real-world field recordings around the world.
This task involves image processing and recognition mechanisms to identify
similarities between bird songs from spectrograms.
A good accuracy performance was achieved using this approach, at the expense of
computation and time costs.
