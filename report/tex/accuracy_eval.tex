\section{Accuracy Evaluation}

a mention on differences in measuring accuracy for single-label vs multi
label classifier

mention any metrics that we do not use but are standard, and explain
why we do not use them.

\subsection{Validation Strategy}
10 times 10kfold

\subsection{Accuracy Metrics}
mean accuracy, f-score, etc
results

\subsection{AUC curve}
we dont use this but if we can construct one then show how we do and what
this tells us

\subsection{Confusion Matrix}
what it is, what it can show us
what it actually shows us
