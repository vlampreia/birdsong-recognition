\section{Classification}
With the feature vectors constructed,a machine learning algorithm is required
to classify the bird species through this model.
This section details the choice of algorithm, it's performance in this task and
how it may be improved.

\subsection{Approaches to Classification}

number of classifiers can be used
skim through some strengths and weaknesses

\subsection{Random Forest Classifier}
A random forest classifier is an ensamble of trees.
A node of a tree is split on an index of the feature vector.
Each Tree uses a new random sampling of the features.

The random 

we pick the random forest.
explain why we use this classifier
explain how it fits with the data we are working with

\subsection{Extremely Randomised Trees}
Extremely Randomised Trees is similar to a traditional Random Forest, however
however splitting is randomised, instead of being computed for optimal
performance.
This has the benefit of being faster, with the drawback of being more sensitive
to noisy features.\\

Using this classifier has seen no major accuracy or performance differences.

\subsection{Parameters}
show parameters available for RF
show initial parameters chosen and their performance
how did we pick these? (make something up)
section (tuning) explores automatic parameter searching and the
effects of varying parameters.
