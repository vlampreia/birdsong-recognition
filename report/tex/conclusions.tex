\chapter{CONCLUSIONS}

write some conclusions
reflection on development 
what was accomplished

- a summary and critical evaluation of what has been achieved

- some feedback on what you personally have learned from the project

- some thoughts to what you would do with more time (what are the
  most important tasks not carried out?), and also how you would
  change your approach if you were tarting over, based on what you
  know now.


  - Does it make sense to discard all but one channel instead of trying
  to merge them? This is slightly surprising to me.
I have not made too much of an analysis on this, and have just taken
the easy path of discarding. Merging may indeed make more sense.
Usually the information is sufficiently similar on both channels, but
in our case the small changes may indeed matter. Merging might
also have a negative impact, perhaps a noise source is more audiable
on one channel, for example. Of course without analysis it doesn't make
sense to discard the right over the left or vice-versa.
Something to reflect on I suppose?

- It's very interesting that blackbird is a problem species. They do
  have comparatively varied songs, and I mostly recognize them by the
  quality of voice rather than any specific phrases. I wonder whether
  for such species one could change the template selection
  parameters.
I plan on looking into the templates extracted for this one and write a 
bit about any findings I may have.

You currently do not at all address standard SE issues in terms of the
design, implementation and testing of the software you produced. This
is fine with me because I am much more interested in what you have
written about. I still felt I should point this out in case you want
to squeeze in a summary.
For this I plan to include some diagrams to describe the flow of data and
how the software is structured.
I am yet to write about my development process, but it will not be
anything too in depth.
I also intend to discuss any difficulties or matters of interest
retrospectively in the conclusion.
Some SE matters are briefly discussed in some of the texts, but I did not
want to dive into too much detail since implementation details are not the
main concern.
No strict testing took place. Something to reflect on again.
