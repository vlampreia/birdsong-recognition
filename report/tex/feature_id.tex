\section{Useful Feature Identification}

Orthonologists use this and that.
We're taking an image recognition based approach

show spectrograms of various species to show differences

Variations in amplitude along the song are not taken into account but may be a 
useful feature to consider.

Direct spectral information such as mean energy per frequency bin is not taken
although this can be a useful statistic to help identify the species.
