\section{Sample Selection}\label{sec:sample_select}
A local database of birdsong samples has been created, using collections
extracted from Xeno-Canto through the described automatic procedure.
Over the course of several days, 2211 total distinct samples have been downloaded
and processed.
189 individual species have been catalogued, with approximately half of these
including more than 10 individual samples.
The top 10 species, and their sample counts are shown in Table~\ref{tab:top10}.
See Appendix~\ref{app:samples} for a full list.
The average length of each recording is approximately 1 minute.

Due to resource limitations imposed by template matching, not all samples
are used in the final evaluation of the algorithm.
Although all samples are processed as described in Section~\ref{sec:prep} and
\ref{sec:preproc}, only a selection is passed through feature extraction and
classification stages.

The following criteria has been found to result in a good balance between
data volume and time cost:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reject species with less than 20 samples
  \item Retain first 20 samples of each species
  \item Reject species with less than 2000 templates
  \item Keep first 3000 templates of each species
\end{itemize}

To reduce bias samples and templates may instaed be picked at random, however
we did not have time to implement a method for tracking the random sampling.
